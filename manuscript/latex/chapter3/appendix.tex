\subsection{Leinonen frost hardiness model}

The model developed by \cite{Leinonen1996} predicts the frost hardiness of tree buds, i.e. their ability to withstand frost without being damaged. The model uses daily temperature, photoperiod, and bud development state (phenological state) as the drivers of bud hardening and dehardening. In particular, a tree undergoes acclimation in response to two factors : decreasing temperatures and shorter days. The damage caused by freezing thus depends on the minimum temperature of day $t$ and the actual frost hardiness $FH_t$ reach on day $t$:
\begin{equation}
FH_t = FH_{min} + CR_t * (\Delta FHT_t + \Delta FHP_t)
\end{equation}

\noindent $FH_{min}$ is the minimum level of frost hardening of a bud expressed in degree celsius and it correspond to the level after bud break when leaves have just unfold (see table above), $CR_t$ is the hardening competence (which depends on the phenological state), $\Delta FHT_t$ is the increase of frost hardiness induced by temperature and $\Delta FHP_t$ is the increase of frost hardiness induced by photoperiod.

\paragraph{Exposure to cold temperatures}

The temperature component $\Delta FHT_t$ is modelled by a piece-wise linear function depending on the daily minimum temperature $T_t$:

\begin{equation}
  \Delta FHT_t =
    \begin{cases}
      FHT_{max} & \text{if $T_t < Te_2$}\\
      FHT_{max}*(1-\frac{T_t-Te_2}{Te_1-Te_2}) & \text{if $Te_2 \leq T_t \leq Te_1$}\\
      0 & \text{if $T_t > Te_1$}
    \end{cases}       
\end{equation}

\noindent $FHT_{max}$, $Te_2$, and $Te_1$ are described in the table above. $FHT_{max}$ correspond to the maximum level of frost hardiness that temperature can induce when the bud is fully dormant during winter.

\paragraph{Photoperiod sensitivity}

The photoperiod component $\Delta FHP_t$ is modelled by a piece-wise linear function depending on the daily night length $NL_t$:

\begin{equation}
  \Delta FHP_t =
    \begin{cases}
      FHP_{max} & \text{if $NL_t > NL_2$}\\
      FHP_{max}*\frac{NL_t-NL_1}{NL_2-NL_1} & \text{if $NL_1 \leq NL_t \leq NL_2$}\\
      0 & \text{if $NL_t < NL_1$}
    \end{cases}       
\end{equation}

\noindent $FHP_{max}$, $NL_2$, and $NL_1$ are described in the table above. $FHP_{max}$ correspond to the maximum level of frost hardiness that photoperiod can induce when the bud is fully dormant during winter. $FHT_{max}$ + $FHP_{max}$ corresponds to the maximum level of frost hardiness that the bud can reach when it is fully dormant during winter.
